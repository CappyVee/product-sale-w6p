# _"Product w6p" - End of Week Six Project_

#### _Practice using CSS styling_

#### By _**Chris Quattrocchi**_

## Description

_End of Week Six project. I'm supposed to use floats, pseudo-elements and a variety of selectors in CSS to style a basic product sale website. In this case, a haunted frying pan.

| TERM | DESCRIPTION | IMPLEMENTATION |
|------|-------------|----------------|
|BOX-SIZING|This tells the browser how to apply the box model|I applied "border box" to all html elements in order to avoid having to wrestle with the margins/padding of each element|
|FLOAT|Takes an element out of the normal flow of the page, forcing them to one side|I applied this to the row of images that help for the footer|
|DISPLAY:BLOCK|display an element as a block, as opposed to an inline element like a paragraph.|Unused|
|DISPLAY:INLINE|Display items in a line, as opposed to a block|I displayed the anchor tags in my list as inline in order to make a navbar|
|CENTERED CONTENT|Adjusts position of content based on parent|This was used for the navbar and header|
|PSEUDO-ELEMENT|Allows you to add content to an element with CSS|This was used to add text blurbs to the footer images.|
|PSEUDO-CLASS|Defines a special state eg :hover|This was used to change the text color of nav items on mouse-over|
|CLEAR-FIX|Used to fix a collapsed parent|I thought I would need to do this to make the opaque background for the text on the right fit properly, but it wasn't necessary.|
|POSITIONAL SELECTOR|Selecting based on nth of child or things like that|I tried to use this to select odd or even imgs in the footer, but it would either apply the effect to all images or none. Not sure why.|
|SELECTOR COMBINATOR|Selecting based on relationship between listed elements|Used to target elements within divs or classes (or other elements)|
